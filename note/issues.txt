1.  So far we consider the all the hash codes of a program as a whole set, leaving out the order of their generation. However,
    the order of sub-group of hash codes can represent some specific sequence of instructions in program!!!

2.  The library shares lots of same hash codes that seems not very interesting. Maybe at some point we can consider splitting
    library code from original code. However, since library code can be statically compiled into the binary, it will make
	things more complicated.

3.  The way we chain the basic block need to improve ---- the order of hash code.

4.  The threshold of the spike in the "unique hash" graph.

5.  It seems to me that java program running on JVM under DR will be a big problem.
