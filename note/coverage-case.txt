This document contains the cases for better coverage of the DR-Launcher test scripts.

1.  The string operation related library functions such as "strlen" "memset" "memcpy" usually have many exit points. This
    makes the join of the "RET" block and the next block and to some degree generate uninteresting new hash codes.

2.  For programs that need directory as its parameters, using absolute path and relative path would make the program run
    sightly different, e.g., "tar -cf test.tar ../ext" and "tar -cf test.tar /home/.../build/ext" will have slight difference.

3.  The output redirection make the program run differently.
3.a One thing worth noting is that the working directory is also a factory of the environment, but it should not affect too 
    much on most programs.

4.  The properties of files or directories affect the program. Known examples are given as following: a) executing "ls" with a
    directory containing only regular files and symbolic links is different; b) executing "ls -l /dev" and "ls -l /" is very
	different because the "/dev" directory contains lots of "device files"; c) executing programs on files or directory is
	different, e.g., "ls /scratch" and "ls /home/user/.../build" are different.
