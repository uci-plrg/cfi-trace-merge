# This file contains issues about how to identify programs from hash sets or execution graphs.

1. Set structure method does not seem to work to identify the programs, because of a few big problems.

2. It is interesting to use the graph techniques, specifically, to check if the graphs are mergable. This method
   is likely to involve more complication and be more expensive than set structure method. There are a few
   concerns in case of merging different graphs.
   a. What does it mean by 'mergable'?
      Actually, any two execution can be thought to be mergable. There are massive use of indirect branches in
	  the graph. One interesting observation here is that every program compiled with the same option (maybe also
	  with the same version of C library) will have a very similar process (initializing the C library or related
	  stuff). Right before it enter the main block of the program, there is a block that uses a indirect jump to
	  enter the real main function. If we start from there, then it would be much easier to tell if two programs
	  are from the same one because the subsequent blocks would be different.
	  However, the problem is how to decide from a graph where this block is (where the entry point locates). It
	  is not easy in terms of different OS, libray and environment.
   b. There are some kind of programs such as Latex that fork many process executing other programs, how to deal
      with that case??

3. For indirect branch, we may need to treat them differently because they can actually jump to any place they
   'want' to. If we do a 'flexible' merge, which means any indirect branches with different targets are mergeable,
   then it turns out that any executions are mergeable. Therefore, we need to do some special treatment to them.
   One interesting indirect branch is the entry of main. For different programs, the entry basic block of main are
   different and maybe few collisions happen there (need further verification). Thus, if we can figure out a way
   to identify that special 'indirect branch' point, most programs can be differentiated. One possible way to
   automatically find out that point (rather than hardcoding) is use a statistical method. Usually, the number of
   targets of a indirect branch is very limitted. If we see in the graph a point that has tens of hundreds or even
   thousands of branch target, we have very high confidence to say it is the point!!

   However, there is another problem to solve in the case of a hash collision or even same code in the first block
   of main function. That's a really tough case!!! We need a survey on many many different existing programs to
   verify how different that 'first main block' is.
