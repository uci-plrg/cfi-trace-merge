#1.  Check first main block of different versions of programs
#2.  Manually write some test cases, which includes cases such as library function calls, call 'exec' to execite
     indirect branch like using function pointer. Also, try different compile option to see if it can change the
	 blocks before the first main blocks. Besides, try the optimization option to check the optimized version of
	 programs and compare them with the non-optimized version. The reason to do this is it may be possible somehow
	 we need to cluster optimized version and non-optimized versions (possibly not!!!)
#3.  Do a survey on how many indirect branch targets a program can possibly have at most
4.   Expand the survey of programs' first main block to programs in /usr/bin or /usr/bin/X11 (some interative
     programs) to verify the conjecture)
5.   Try to change the environment of the program. However, this may be very hard because all machines we have now
     are running in the exact same environment. Maybe I can try to use some kind of virtual machine...
#6.  For those programs pair with same first main block, check if they can are mergeable!!!
*7.  Split the big graph file into different files for different processes, requires DR hacking!!! By the way,
     some executions of DR are wired and do not output graph files, e.g.:
	 
	 tex -interaction=batchmode -output-directory=/scratch/crowd-safe-test-data/output/development/latex -mltex -ini -jobname=/scratch/crowd-safe-test-data/input/latex/gentle.tex /scratch/crowd-safe-test-data/input/latex/gentle.tex
